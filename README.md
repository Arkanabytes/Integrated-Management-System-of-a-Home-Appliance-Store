Object-oriented programming with Java

In this document the knowledge of Java studied during the second semester will be put into play: implementation of basic concepts of object-oriented programming, the main objective of this document is to offer a possible solution to the practice of the subject "HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES STORE" of the present academic year 2017-2018.
For its correct operation, I tried to apply the main functions of this problem such as abstraction, over writing, inheritance and encapsulation, also using the interface recommended by the teaching team that was BlueJ.
She will try to carry out an automated management program for an electrical appliance store, that is to say, managing herself, during the development of the program I had to have a series of criticisms when building the program.
In our store we will have to manage the following main entities that are:
 Customers: each customer can buy a product, create a file, customer have financing options, after-sales service, technical service and this in turn, control the inheritance of the person class.
 Employee: in the employees section, a new employee can be created, display the overtime payments, salary, overtime base type IRPF, if you are married and / or have children and, in turn, you will have the inheritance of the person class where you It will also manage everything that the practice statement asks us:
